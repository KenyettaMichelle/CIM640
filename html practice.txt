What is a function which is console.log
they are instructions put together to make it easy to complete a task


with any function use it
camelcase example printMessage
make function modular
you have to ask yourself questions all the time
like message its like math
name in (name) is a variable

declare your function first and then call it
like bake the cake first then eat


        function addNumbers(add1, add2) {
            var addition = add1 + add2;
            return addition;
        }
        // functions have to be declared and called.
        printMessage();
        sayHello("Zeven");
        sayHello("Amy");
        //The message variable is outside of the main programs scope
        //console.log(message);
        var firstAddition = addNumbers(1,2);
        var secondAddition = addNumbers(2347234,256293794);
        console.log(firstAddition);
        console.log(secondAddition);


button has 3 types button reset and sumbit in side the button type
<button type+


    <button type="button"onclick="sayHello('Kenyetta')">Click Here to say hello</button>
single and double quotes to create a compound statement

Use forms to grab input from users
create an interactive calculator
take in a par or two and print it out in the scripting

As interaction designer...question do I use check box or radio...
starting to figure out what is the functionality of my program and go through programming...The assignment coming 
back from the storm over the next week...make a calculator..look up what is a code plan...be able to talk through the program 
what the user does and what the program will do...like this a program that does this..

how to create a calculator that is fun like...How many licks does it take to get to the center of a 
tootsie pop...going through all the steps that a user will go through..the goal is the user would have
already licked the lolly pop...can use a text box to input data...will have to figure out the function
create a function called lick counter...so have to write code for that ratio is input of person divided by 250 than multiply by 100 to get ratio
look under code plan
